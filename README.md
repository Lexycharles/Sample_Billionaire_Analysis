### Recommendations

- Targeting industries with the highest average net worth, such as Telecom, Automotive, and Technology, for greater potential returns.
- Understanding age trends: The majority of billionaires are 60 years and above, suggesting that wealth accumulation is a long-term process.
- Considering the U.S. market: Since most billionaires reside in the United States, it may offer better business opportunities and investment climates.

### Limitations

- The dataset only includes 475 billionaires and may not represent all billionaires worldwide.
- Some net worth values fluctuate due to stock market changes, making them subject to variations.
- The self-made vs. inherited categorization might not always be precise, as wealth transfer mechanisms can be complex.
